Our Metagenomics-based Drug Discovery Lab, which is based in KAIMRC and Collage of Pharmacy in King Saud bin Abdulaziz University, uses various aspects of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to build a metagenomic pipeline. Our research aims to shape the largest database of environmental DNA (eDNA)  for Drug Discovery in Saudi Arabia.
